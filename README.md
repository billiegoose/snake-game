# snake-game

I just felt like making a snake game this evening. It's ASCII, runs in the terminal.

Update: Of course, @mafintosh already has 'snake-game' on npm and his is in _color_.
And more importantly, he got the squares to be the right aspect ratio.
So I decided to replicate that look.

Which is pretty funny, because I built this using [diffy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/diffy)
which is _also_ by @mafintosh.
His snake-game is built using [clivas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clivas) - also by @mafintosh.

My snake game is responsive (adapts to the terminal screen size) though. :grin:
